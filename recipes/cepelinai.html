      <h1>Cepelinai</h1>
      <img src="../images/cepelinai.jpg">
      <p>Cepelinai (potato-meat dumplings) are the most well known Lithuanian dish. It might seem a bit
         tricky to make them at home, but just make sure to have the right potatoes
         and food grating machine!
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>1 pound ground pork</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>3 teaspoons salt </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>1 large egg, beaten </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>10 large starchy potatoes, peeled and finely grated, about 6 1/2 pounds</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>1 tablespoon cornstarch </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions:</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>In a large bowl, mix together ground meat, finely chopped onion, the salt, 
               a few grinds of pepper, and the egg until well combined. Cover and refrigerate 
               until ready to use.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Place grated potatoes in a fine-mesh cheesecloth or cotton dishtowel, and twist 
               over a large bowl to get rid of the excess water. 
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Pour off the water, reserving the potato starch at the bottom of the bowl.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Unwrap the cheesecloth and place the raw potatoes in the bowl with the potato 
               starch you reserved from the bottom of the bowl. 
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Put a large stockpot of well-salted water on to boil. </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>To form the cepelinai, take about 1 cup of dumpling mixture and pat 
               it flat in the palm of the hand. Place 1/4 cup or more of meat mixture in the center and, 
               using slightly dampened hands, fold the potato mixture around the meat into a football 
               shape, sealing well. Continue until both mixtures are used. 
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Carefully lower dumplings (in batches if necessary to prevent crowding) into salted, 
               boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of cornstarch has been added.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Make sure water returns to the boil; reduce the heat to low and continue simmering 
               until the filling is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon or strainer, drain briefly on a clean dish 
               towel and place on a heated platter. 
            </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
